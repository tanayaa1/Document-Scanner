## 💸Applications
-As mentioned in the topic we have designed a document scanner. The motivation for this project is that, in day-to-day life we deal with a lot of paperwork and a scanner is always not accessible and feasible. That is when the doc scanner can be used. Even as a student we need to make pdfs of various documents, be it assignments or important documents. So, we decided to design something that is useful in our daily lives.
The doc scanner scans the document and displays it. We have applied the concept of OpenCv as we make use of a real time document to be scanned
